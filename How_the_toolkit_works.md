## Step 1 - Adding toolkit content
The toolkit content is stored on the github servers under the <a href="https://github.com/astro4dev/OAD-Data-Science-Toolkit" target="_blank">OAD-Data-Science-Toolkit</a> repository. Content is added by individual contributors by first cloning the repository, making the changes, then creating a pull request. The astro4dev data science working group are automatically informed about the new pull request. The request is then verified before it is added to the main astro4dev repository.

## Step 2 - Adding the content to the database

Once the content has been uploaded to github it has to be added to the MySQL database. This is done by a member of the astro4dev data science working group. The database is composed of many tables which can be dividied into two groups.

- Content Tables
- Relational Tables
