The overall objective of this toolkit is to provide a foundation for a “common language” between the data science and astronomy communities. The toolkit should help astronomers get a sense of the breadth of data science (as a field and in its applications) and see where their skills and knowledge fit into this wider view; and should help data scientists and those in need of data scientists (e.g. companies, NGOs)  see what astronomers can contribute.

More specifically, the toolkit will provide

- A map to existing data science resources, so that those planning data science instruction programmes in astronomy are aware of what has already been done and what can be covered.
- A high quality teaching resources and assessments, for student- and self-assessment.
- Instructors with easily accessible guidance and further information on how to teach effectively and inclusively.
