# Astrophysical Machine Learning

This is a directed study course written and tought by [Dr. Shea Brown](https://stackedit.io/) at the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/).

The course introduces the basics of the python programming language, machine-learning, and astrophysical image processing.

## Syllabus

> **Part 1: Introduction to Python.**
>Python basics, including basic mathematical operations and control functions, writing and executing scripts, Numpy and basic matrix math. Introduction to classes, methods, and basic object-oriented programing. Basic plotting of data will also be covered. The first part continues with more advanced python and mathematics, including modeling and fitting data, (stochastic) gradient descent, and basic Bayesâ€™ Theorem.

> **Part 2: Introduction to Astrophysics.**
>History and Atlas of the Universe, including an overview of the various fields of Astrophysics/Astronomy. Introduction to astronomical images, catalogs and relevant data formats. Practical exercises with real astronomy data, utilizing out-of-the-box machine learning algorithms.

> **Part 3: Introduction to Machine Learning**
> Overview of Machine Learning and AI, including supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Deep learning will be introduced, as will more advanced topics at a superficial level.

> **Part 4: Projects**
