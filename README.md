# OAD Data Science Toolkit

![alt tag](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Heavy%20Development-red.svg?style=flat)

The overall objective of this toolkit is to provide a foundation for a “common language” between the data science and astronomy communities. The toolkit should help astronomers get a sense of the breadth of data science (as a field and in its applications) and see where their skills and knowledge fit into this wider view; and should help data scientists and those in need of data scientists (e.g. companies, NGOs)  see what astronomers can contribute.

More specifically, the toolkit will provide (1) a map to existing data science resources, so that those planning data science instruction programmes in astronomy are aware of what has already been done and what can be covered (2) high quality teaching resources and assessments, for student- and self-assessment and (3) allow instructors to easily access guidance and further information on how to teach effectively and inclusively.
