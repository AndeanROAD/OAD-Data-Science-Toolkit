The process of classifying objects plays a crucial role in science. By grouping objects based on their similarities we are expecting to expose underlying physical processes responsible for the classification. Nonetheless it happens often that man made classifications use empirical boundaries which are then subject to a lot of debate. This sometimes very tedious task of classifying objects has recently benefited from technological and theoretical developments. Indeed, over the last years the rise of machine learning and especially unsupervised clustering techniques has opened up possibilities to further investigate new similarities and patterns within a data set. 

In this notebook we introduce the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) analysis done in [Souza et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07607.pdf) to classify galaxies using the python scikit-learn library.
