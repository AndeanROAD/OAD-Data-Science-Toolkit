Materials for a hands-on introduction to machine learning, first given at UCL. This is designed to be a crash course intro to machine learning, not an in depth course.

To run the jupyter notebook, you need python, scikit-learn, jupyter, numpy and matplotlib. Anaconda is highly recommended. The notebook should run in both python 2 and 3.

To run, simply type this into your terminal:
`jupyter notebook tutorial.ipynb`

There is also a (python 2) notebook on a deep learning example with keras (https://keras.io) which is quite old so probably doesn't work anymore but gives an idea about deep learning.
