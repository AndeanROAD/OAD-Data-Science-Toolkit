    <td><b>Think Stats</b><br>Think Stats is an introduction to Probability and Statistics for Python programmers.
    Think Stats emphasizes simple techniques you can use to explore real data sets and answer interesting questions. The book presents a case study using data from the National Institutes of Health. Readers are encouraged to work on a project with real datasets. If you have basic skills in Python, you can use them to learn concepts in probability and statistics.Think Stats is based on a Python library for probability distributions (PMFs and CDFs). Many of the exercises use short programs to run experiments and help readers develop understanding.

    <td><b>Think Stats</b><br>Think Bayes is an introduction to Bayesian statistics using computational methods. The premise of this book, and the other books in the Think X series, is that if you know how to program, you can use that skill to learn other topics. Most books on Bayesian statistics use mathematical notation and present ideas in terms of mathematical concepts like calculus. This book uses Python code instead of math, and discrete approximations instead of continuous mathematics. As a result, what would be an integral in a math book becomes a summation, and most operations on probability distributions are simple loops.

    <td><b>An Introduction to Statistical Learning</b><br>This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist.

    <td><b>From Algorithms to Z-Scores: Probabilistic and Statistical Modeling in Computer Science</b><br>The materials here form a textbook for a course in mathematical probability and statistics for computer science students. (It would work fine for general students too). More info <a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/probstatbook" target="_blank">here</a>.</td>
