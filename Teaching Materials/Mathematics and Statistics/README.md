    <td><b>An Introduction to Statistical Learning</b><br>This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist.<br>The book is available for download <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/" target="_blank">here</a>.
